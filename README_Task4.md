# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning 📧

## 📌 Internship Task
**Internship:** Oasis Infobyte  
**Task:** Task 4 - Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning  

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses on building an Email Spam Detection system using Machine Learning.
The model classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on the message content.
Text processing and classification techniques are used to detect unwanted or malicious emails.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** SMS Spam Collection
- **File Name:** spam.csv
- **Columns Used:**
  - label (spam / ham)
  - message (email or SMS text)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Removed unnecessary columns
3. Encoded target labels (spam / ham)
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Converted text data into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorizer
6. Trained a Naive Bayes classifier
7. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
8. Visualized results using a confusion matrix
9. Tested the model with custom email input

---

## 📌 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Place `spam.csv` in the same directory as the notebook
3. Open `email_spam_detection.ipynb`
4. Run all cells sequentially
