# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning 🚗

## 📌 Internship Task
**Internship:** Oasis Infobyte  
**Task:** Task 3 - Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning  

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project aims to predict the selling price of a car using Machine Learning techniques.  
The car price depends on various factors such as the year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, and ownership history.  
A Linear Regression model is trained to predict car prices based on these features.

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Linear Regression

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Handled missing values
4. Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
5. Removed non-numeric column (Car_Name)
6. Split data into training and testing sets
7. Trained a Linear Regression model
8. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R2 score
9. Visualized actual vs predicted prices
10. Tested the model with sample input

---

## 📌 Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R2 Score

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Place `car data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook
3. Open `car_price_prediction.ipynb`
4. Run all cells sequentially
