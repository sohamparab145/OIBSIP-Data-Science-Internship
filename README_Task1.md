# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📌 Internship Task
**Internship:** Oasis Infobyte  
**Task:** Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification  

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a Machine Learning classification task that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.  
The model classifies flowers into three categories:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Name: Iris Dataset
- File: Iris.csv
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Species

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Logistic Regression

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Preprocessed the data
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained the Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
7. Tested the model with sample input

---

## ✅ Model Performance
- Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset
- Generated classification report for evaluation
