# Sales Prediction Using Python 📊

## 📌 Internship Task
**Internship:** Oasis Infobyte  
**Task:** Task 5 - Sales Prediction Using Python  

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure using Machine Learning.
The goal is to understand how different advertising platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper affect sales.
A Linear Regression model is trained to predict future sales.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Advertising Dataset
- **File Name:** Advertising.csv
- **Features:**
  - TV
  - Radio
  - Newspaper
- **Target Variable:**
  - Sales

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Linear Regression

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Removed unnecessary columns
3. Performed correlation analysis
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R2 score
7. Visualized actual vs predicted sales
8. Tested the model with sample advertising data

---

## 📌 Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R2 Score

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Place `Advertising.csv` in the same directory as the notebook
3. Open `sales_prediction.ipynb`
4. Run all cells sequentially
